# Dotfiles
Dotfiles for personal use, including nvim, tmux and zsh configurations.

## Preview
![Preview](markdown/preview.gif "Preview")

## Installation
Run install.sh and it should hopefully work.
There are a few caveats:
- ~/.profile, ~/.zprofile, ~/.zshenv, ~/.tmux.conf are overridden
- Rust is only installed on Ubuntu due to usage of snap
- Pretty aggressive in general and meant for fresh machines
